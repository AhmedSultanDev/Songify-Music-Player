# Songify-Music-Player
Songify is a music player made with native Android and iOS code. Currently being tested on Android so the iOS version is not published until testing is complete.

For installation, simply download the .apk file on your Android device or Android emulator and run install.

Note: This is still early work in progress, general design and layout is considered mostly complete but there is still a lot of work to be done with animations and key functions.
